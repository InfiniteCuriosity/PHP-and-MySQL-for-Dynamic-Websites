# PHP-and-MySQL-for-Dynamic-Websites
This is where I'll store files as I work through the book PHP and MySQL for Dynamic Websites by Larry Ullman

I find this book by Larry Ullman to be an excellent introduction to PHP and MySQL. I'm already familiar with PHP and MySQL, but Larry brings a lot of great ideas to using PHP and MySQL, this is very enjoyable.

This repository is where I'll post my answers to the questions and work in the book.
